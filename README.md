## Project Briefing 

**_Geldium_** - a financial services provider specializing in digital lending and consumer credit. The company has observed an increase in credit card delinquency rates, with more customers missing payments beyond the 30-day late payment threshold. To improve risk management and customer engagement, they have engaged Tata iQ to develop an AI-powered predictive solution that helps identify at-risk customers and recommend appropriate interventions.

- **Use AI-driven insights** to help predict which customers are likely to miss payments.
- **Support the Head of Collections with targeted intervention strategies** to reduce delinquency.
- **Ensure fairness and transparency in AI-driven risk assessments** while aligning with industry practices.

### ✅ Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted an in-depth EDA on a 500-record financial dataset covering:

**Features analyzed:** Credit score, income, loan balance, credit utilization, payment history, employment status, credit card type, location.

**Missing Data:** Income (7.8%), Loan Balance (5.8%), Credit Score (0.4%)
 
Used MICE imputation for complex numerical gaps to preserve inter-variable relationships.

**Key Risk Indicators Identified:**
  
*	Business credit card holders – 21.29% delinquency rate
  
*	Unemployed individuals – 19.35%
  
*	Los Angeles residents – 19.62%

*	Customers with >4 missed payments + >50% credit utilization had 20.63% delinquency rate.

*	Insightful anomaly: Income and missed payments showed unexpected weak correlations with delinquency, hinting at non-linear or hidden interactions.
